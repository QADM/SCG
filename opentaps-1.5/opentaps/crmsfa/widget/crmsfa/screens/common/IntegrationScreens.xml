This is the framework used to wrap ofbiz screen "as a whole" within our application.
That means that we can use any ofbiz screen without having to change it.  It will still be wrapped
inside of the crmsfa tab that we want it to be in.

In order to wrap an ofbiz screen in this application,

1.  Define the mainDecoratorLocation parameter in web.xml and point to this file.
2.  Make sure the ofbiz screen defines a headerItem.  This is usually the case.
3.  In the crmsfa/config/headerItemSections.properties file, map this headerItem value to the section it should appear in.
4.  Include the request and view map from the ofbiz application in the crmsfa legacy-controller.xml file.
    There is no need to change the values of these, because this system works automagically.

    The ofbiz import screen is responsible for rendering ofbiz screens with a crmsfa skin around it. When the application detects an ofbiz screen,
    usually by existance of headerItem parameter, it will call this screen. This is basically a stripped down GlobalDecorator fromcommon/widgets/CommonScreens.xml, which
    includes all important parts of an ofbiz screen: the optional leftbar, the column style, and a paramatrized link. It leaves out the ofbiz stuff that
    we don't need, such as the ofbiz application tab bar and section tab bar.
