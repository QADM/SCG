# This file is used to configure how screens from OFBiz should be mapped to the sections (Accounts, Contacts, Leads, Opportunities, etc.) in CRM/SFA
# Each screen in an OFBiz Screens.xml file has a headerItem configured, to tell OFBiz which header button is selected.  (In OFBiz, the "Accounting", "Content", etc.
# tabs on top is collectively called the appbar, and the buttons under neath ("Agreements", "Billing Accounts", etc.) is called the app header.
# This mapping basically defines which section in CRM/SFA the imported screens should go, based on their defined headerItems

# We also need to define the title and header labels for each
