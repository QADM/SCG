323807b20cf1d1e799e670f45ae8fc7500189def #1917 Change order item name for purchase order, append the product standard features

Other API Changes
-----------------

- UtilDateTime.toCalendar must have a TimeZone set or will throw a NPE. This can be indirect if for example the method s called from a service getting those from the context without checking
if the timezone / locale are actually set. UtilDate.toCalendar handles this case more gracefully by defaulting to the system timezone / locale.
Note: this only affects two services in WorkEffortServices.java : processWorkEffortEventReminders and getWorkEffortEventsByPeriod

- Since the move to generics, UtilMisc.addToBigDecimalInMap is not working for a Map<?, BigDecimal>, instead use UtilCommon.addInMapOfBigDecimal

- ServiceUtil.isSucess was moved to UtilCommon

- The base users (admin, system, ...) and UserLogin seed data is no longer loaded by ofbiz, instead it is loaded as demo data. The needed data was added into CommonSecurityData.xml


Possible buisness logic changes
-------------------------------

opentaps/opentaps-common/src/common/org/opentaps/domain/order/OrderItemShipGroup.java
r13023 getEstimatedShipDate is now also a field of the OISG entity, the method now takes this value into account.
If the ship group may split, the calculated date is the earliest of the estimatedShipDate set on the OISG and the promisedDatetime of the related OrderItemShipGrpInvRes.
Else it is the latest of those values.
TODO: see when this value get set and with which value, else we can use it to cache the result of this method or just ignore it and leave it to null.

Specialpurpose changes
----------------------

specialpurpose/ecommerce/data/DemoOrderTestData.xml
c2bc53033729e40849efcf2a1b84e8a45a130ff7 Commenting DemoGlSetupData.xml, DemoAcctgTransactionData.xml, DemoPaymentsInvoices.xml certain sections of DemoOrderTestData.xml as they interfere with Opentaps financials and demo data load process.
