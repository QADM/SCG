Instead of using a screen to do the layout, we use an ftl.  
This is because doing multicolumn layout in CSS as OFBiz does is really
difficult (CSS is weak in this respect).

This may also be the platform for refactoring order header. 

Notice how we replaced the screens.render with #include directives.  These subscreens do not have
any special data that is not set up in orderview.bsh, so the screen render call is redundant.
If special data is needed, either add a new bsh to run after orderview.bsh or include in orderview.bsh.
The whole idea is to keep things simple and not use the screen widget where unnecessary.
