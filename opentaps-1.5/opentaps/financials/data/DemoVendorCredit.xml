    <!-- a somewhat hacky configuration of vendor credit payments: this payment method type can be used for incoming and outgoing payments and is configured
    to the Vendor Credits account (154000), while the Vendor Credit Receipt payment type is configured to the Due From Vendor account (123100).  The process configured
    is as of the following:

    1.  Receive a payment of the type "Vendor Credit Receipt" and method "Vendor Credit" from your vendor, causing
    DR Vendor Credit, CR Due from Vendor

    2.  Make a payment of the type "Vendor Payment" back to your vendor using this payment method "Vendor credit", causing
    DR Accounts Payable, CR Vendor Credit

    Note that the Vendor Credit payment method would be unnecessary if the make outgoing payment screen could be made dynamic to allow either a payment method or a type,
    or a separate apply vendor credit to a vendor invoice screen is created.
