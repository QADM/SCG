To integrate a screen from OFBiz, 

1)  The screen to be integrated must declare the decorator screen with a location attribute pointing to a variable in parameters map,
    <decorator-screen name="FooDecorator" location="${parameters.fooDecoratorLocation}">

2)  Our version of this screen should <set> the parameter variable and point to this file
    <set field="parameters.fooDecoratorLocation" location="component://warehouse/widget/warehouse/screens/common/IntegrationScreens.xml"/>

3)  Our version of the screen should then <include-screen name="TargetScreenName" location="component://path/to/TargetScreen.xml"/>
