Saiku Analytics - Pentaho BI-Server Plugin
------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the Plugin version of the Saiku Analytics application.
It allows you to create, manipulate and save/load queries like in the standalone version,
but also fully integrates in the Pentaho BI-Server.

This means you can save and load queries directly into the Pentaho Solution Repository
and access the configured OLAP datasources in pentaho-solutions/system/olap/datasources.xml


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IMPORTANT NOTES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


QUERY FILES:
------------------------------------------------------------------
Those files have the same format as in the Saiku standalone Web-Application. 
This means if you access the standalone version of saiku via e.g. http://localhost:8080/saiku/ and save queries
there, you can re-use the same queries in the solution repository and vice-versa.

The query files of the standalone version are stored in something equivalent to: 
	tomcat/webapps/saiku/WEB-INF/classes/saiku-repository

The query files of the plugin are somewhere stored in your pentaho solution repository:
	biserver-ce/pentaho-solutions/......
	
USING THE SAME MONDRIAN AS THE BISERVER:
------------------------------------------------------------------

you can use the saiku-shareMondrian.sh provided in this folder or:

delete the following JAR files from saiku/lib/
- mondrian*.jar, olap4j*.jar, eigenbase*.jar (should be 1 mondrian, 2 olap4j, 3 eigenbase jar files)
- open saiku/plugin.spring.xml and remove the following line (about line #33):
......
		<property name="datasourceResolverClass" value="org.saiku.plugin.PentahoDataSourceResolver" />
.....

restart your server or use the plugin adapter refresh in http://localhost:8080/pentaho/Admin
thats it!
