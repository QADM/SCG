description=This is an example of using a global filter and a session filter.  <p/>The global filter is DEPARTMENT_LIST which provides values for the DEPARTMENT parameter.  DEPARTMENT_LIST is	generated by doing an SQL 'select distinct' on the departments column.  Being a global filter, the query is executed only once and available to all users. <p/>The session filter REGION_FILTER is generated by a rule that is executed for each user that logs in.  The values are stored in the user's session and is available as long as the user remains logged in.
